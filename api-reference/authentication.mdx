There are two ways to authenticate with the API: **API Keys** and **JWT tokens**.

## API Keys

You can find your API key by contacting the LevelTwo team. Soon it will be available in the [LevelTwo Dashboard](https://ltwo.io/dashboard/developers).

<Warning>This key should only be used on the server side, do not use this key in the browser.</Warning>

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <api_key>'
```

## JWT Tokens

Coming soon
