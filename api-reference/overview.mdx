# Integration Guide

This guide shows you how to use LevelTwo with just the API and without any frontend components or SDKs. This is useful if you are integrating with a system that already has a frontend, or if you are building a custom frontend.

## How it Works
1. [Signing Up](#signing-up)
2. [Authentication](#authentication)
2. [Create a Persona](#create-a-persona)
3. [Get matching personas for a Lead](#get-matching-personas-for-a-lead)

## Signing Up

Register your username and password by contacting the LevelTwo team. 
<b>Do NOT expose or store the credentials on the front-end or public client</b>
Use this to get the access token to be used in Bearer Authentication for all subsequent API calls.

## Authentication

Obtain the access token using the token API and append it in the header of each request.
```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <api_key>'
```

## Create a Persona

A persona is a set of rules over different attributes like date of birth, address, last name, etc. 
To create these fill the details and share with the LevelTwo team. Any number of these can be created.
Also, a unique identifier will be shared which can be used to interpret the API results.

## Get matching personas for a Lead

Given that there are a bunch of prepopulated personas. Any new lead can be matched against those 
and in case of a absolute match the unique identifier will be mapped to true in the response.
