# Backend Integration Guide

This guide shows you how to use LevelTwo with just the API and without any frontend components or SDKs. This is useful if you are integrating with a system that already has a frontend, or if you are building a custom frontend.

## How it Works
1. [Get your API Keys](#getting-your-api-keys)
2. [Create a user](#create-user)
3. [Order Credit Report](#order-credit-report)

## Getting your API Keys

You can find your API key and Organization ID by contacting the LevelTwo team. The key will only be available post the customer profile specification by the partner. Soon it will be available in the [LevelTwo Dashboard](https://ltwo.io/dashboard/developers).

<b>Do NOT expose this key on the front-end</b>, it is for back-end use only.

## Create user

You can send the details of your customer to create a user id and check if their financial data is cached or not. The API returns the confidence score along with the availability based on the profile configured by the partner.

## Order Credit Report

The Credit Report is a compilation of data on an individual that is helpful in making decisions in many types of consumer transactions. The Credit Report contains various data about the consumer, including indicative information (name, addresses, date of birth, and Social Security number), employment information, and the consumer's credit history.
